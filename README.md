### Summary

-------------------------------------------------

An mobile-friendly online shopping community with an admin dashboard, made for demonstration purposes. Built with ReactJs+Material-UI, Vue.js+Element UI and Laravel 6.

The first reason why I start this project because I want to try the solution that uses Laravel, ReactJs and Vue.js to create a web application. On top of that, I uses Kijiji.ca a lot, I think maybe I can create a similar website as well. 

To build and develop this project, you will need:

- PHP 7 and composer installed
- Node.js 12x and npm installed



### Functionality

----------------------------------

- User Register
- User Login
- Editing User Profile
- Creating New Posts
- Deleting and Removing Posts
- Adding Tags to Posts
- Uploading and Deleting Images for Posts
- Home Page Live Searching
- Live Searching in Tags
- Real-time Chatting with Sellers

- Editing Posts, Tags, Users and Admin Users in Admin Dashboard

### Schedule

------------------------------------------------

The following list is what's going to be implement in the future iterations.

1. New Message Notifications
2. Uploading and Editing User Avatar
3. Infinite Scrolling and Lazy Loading in Home Page and Admin Dashboard
2. More Features in Admin Dashboard
3. Availability Update for the User Front-end
2. Android/IOS App in Flutter or React Native
3. Desktop Application in Electron
