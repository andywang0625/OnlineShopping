### Summary

-------------------------------------------------

An online shopping site for demonstration purposes. Built with React.Js, Laravel 6 and Material-UI.

The first reason why I start this project because I want to try the solution that uses both Laravel and React.Js to create a web application. On top of that, I uses Kijiji.ca a lot, I think maybe I can make a similar website as well.
